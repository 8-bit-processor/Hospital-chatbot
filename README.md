# Chatbot

This project implements a Python-based chatbot designed to assist with medical-related inquiries. It leverages a hybrid approach combining semantic similarity and a custom-built neural network for natural language understanding.

## Features

*   **Intent Recognition**: Identifies user intentions such as scheduling appointments (general and specialty), requesting medical imaging, medical supplies, medication renewals, and general information.
*   **Semantic Search**: Utilizes `sentence-transformers` to find the most semantically similar predefined questions to user input, enabling robust understanding of varied phrasing.
*   **Neural Network Classifier**: Employs a custom-implemented feed-forward neural network for intent classification, trained on embeddings generated by the semantic model.
*   **Text Preprocessing**: Includes a dedicated module for cleaning and normalizing text data, preparing it for machine learning models.
*   **Extensible Knowledge Base**: Intents and responses are defined in `intents.py`, making it easy to add or modify the chatbot's capabilities.

## Project Structure

*   `main.py`: The main entry point of the chatbot application. It orchestrates the loading of models, training, and user interaction.
*   `intents.py`: Defines the `qa_pairs` (question-answer/action pairs) that serve as the chatbot's knowledge base and training data.
*   `similarity_model_and_neural_net.py`: Contains the core implementations of the `SimilarityModel` (using `sentence-transformers`) and the custom `NeuralNetwork` for intent classification.
*   `neural_net_text_preprocessor.py`: Provides the `TextPreprocessor` class for cleaning, normalizing, and vectorizing text data.
*   `__pycache__/`: Directory for Python bytecode cache.
*   `.venv/`: Virtual environment for managing project dependencies.
*   `nltk_data/`: Directory for NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) data, specifically the `punkt` tokenizer.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd chatbot
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows:
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(The `requirements.txt` file has been generated for you.)*

4.  **Download NLTK data:**
    The `main.py` and `neural_net_text_preprocessor.py` scripts will attempt to download the `punkt` tokenizer if it's not found. Ensure you have an internet connection on the first run.

## Usage

To start the chatbot, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

The chatbot will initialize, train its neural network, and then prompt you for input. Type your queries, and type `exit` to end the conversation.

## Extending the Chatbot

To add new intents or modify existing ones, edit the `qa_pairs` list in `intents.py`. After making changes, retrain the model by running `main.py`.

## Dependencies

*   `sentence-transformers`
*   `numpy`
*   `nltk`
*   `torch` (for `sentence-transformers`)
*   `scikit-learn` (for `TfidfVectorizer` in `neural_net_text_preprocessor.py`)
